The goal for this project is to use data sets in orde to train an ai model to reccomend music to be used in record sampling based on emotion.
This is based on how I approach music production and I am curious to see how an Ai trained model would perform in this situation.

Firstly I researched data sets and resources in order to get a solid foundation.

CAL500 was the first data set I found could be useful. Created by Turnbull, D., Barrington, L., Torres, D., Lanckriet G. , songs picked within the last 50 years in 2006
in the expirements students reported 18 identifieable emotions

  in addition to how to use the data sets
